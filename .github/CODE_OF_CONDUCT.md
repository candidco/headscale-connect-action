## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering a respectful and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a positive experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using respectful language
- Being considerate of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing understanding towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of inappropriate language or imagery and unwelcome attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Attribution
